  storyShort:
    "Born on the streets of Tirunelveli, Retro Clothing started as a pop-up cart with one idea — timeless silhouettes shouldn't cost a fortune. Every piece we cut carries that promise forward.",
  storyLong:
    "Retro Clothing began in 2026 as Tirunelveli's first aesthetic clothing cart — a single folding table, a rail of shirts, and a stubborn belief that small-town India deserved fashion with real intention behind it. What started as a weekend pop-up on Mela Mount Road grew into a full wardrobe label built on the same principle: cut fabric like it matters, price it like it's for everyone. Today Retro Clothing ships across India, but the process hasn't changed — every piece is still designed, checked and packed by hand from our Tirunelveli workshop, for people who want luxury without the luxury markup.",
